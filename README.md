# Machine Learning

In this repository, you will find all the files used for analysing the results of the experiment conducted during the course [Machine Learning](https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2018-2019-en/search-course/course/59036) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/home).


## Introduction

The objective of the assignments was to apply the topics seen in class such as:
- K-nearest neighbors algorithm
- Model selection
- Linear models for regression and classification
- Decision trees and random forests
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Imputation and feature selection
- Support vector machines for classification and regression
- Evaluation metrics
- Working with imbalanced datasets
- Clustering and cluster evaluation
- Non-negative matrix factorization and outlier detection

## Data

The data was provided by the course and can be found in the corresponding files. The variables and files are in Dutch however the langauge barrier is not an obstacle in understanding the objectives and results.

## Prerequisites

These files require Jupyter and Python 3.7, however the raw data can be analysed using a variety of software.
